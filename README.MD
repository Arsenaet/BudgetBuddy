## Installation
this is gonna be step by step build instructons, if you have any technical knowlage, everything SHOULD be understanadble cause of the requirements, you also need a .env with a perplexity API key and secretkey (PERPLEXITY_API_KEY and ServerSecret)
###Requirements

**A couple of these are from testing, so arent used but are still on the install list because I dont care**

literally just run these terminal commands and you're set (these are on a unix based system, if you run windows sorry, just use linux bro, its so worth it)
```
git clone https://github.com/Arsenaet/BudgetBuddy
cd BudgetBuddy
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install sqlalchemy flask_sqlalchemy (was messed up in build requirements lol)
make your .env file with your secrets and API keys as outlined above using your text editor of choice (hopefully neovim)
flask run -h app.py
```
Easy as that, your server is deplopyed, all you gotta do now is go to your web browser of choice and open localhost to port 8000
